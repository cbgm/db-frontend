Doing this for several years now I can say it is more than just a job - it has become one of my passions. Not forgetting to mention that i always was interested into programming and designing stuff, I especially setteled in Webdevelopment the last years.

						"it's still dominating my life. The originally trigger was " +
						"a video game that lead me into it. &quotWhat a video game? How can that be?&quot Even a video game can " +
						"show the energy flow, the attitude and community of a sport. Since I met skateboarding it helped me " +
						"through some rough times and made me find some of my best friends. Also the feeling of being free in what " +

						"german friends. This movie was also their Master-Thesis for Media School. Of course you can't expect anything back from " +
						"this sport if you don't do it with your heart, and yep ...there are times in real pain. But as it " +
						"is in life, with hard work it pays out. " +
						
						"</br></br>Talking about the community, there is no hate as " +
						"in other 'team sports'. You support and party with your friends when they land/master a hard " +
						"trick. There is no hard competition, even on professional nivau. It's all about having a good time with " +

							"</br>The next new technichal experience began in spreading photos online that were shot at skating. " +
							"At first with the help of Frontpage, which is pretty " +
							"crappy these days. But after some time I tried my best with HTML and Macromedia Flash (Actionscript), still love Flash though. " +
							"</br></br>After the years i came in contact with all kinds of technology, whether programming and it's " +

								"began and I dived into the C-Wolrd, databases and so on. Little programs like a file-manager or an automatic data update tool, held me up. Now I'm pretty much able" +
